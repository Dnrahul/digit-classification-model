# file format readme.me

For a README file, use plain text Markdown and name it `README.md` (not `readme.me`) so platforms like GitHub detect and render it automatically.[^1]

## Basic README.md structure

You can follow this general format:

```markdown
# Project Title

Short 1–2 line description of what the project does.

## Features

- Main functionality.
- Technologies used.
- Any key highlights.

## Requirements

- List of dependencies.
- How to install them.

## Usage

1. Steps to set up.
2. How to run the code or notebook.
3. Example command.

## Project Structure

- Brief description of important files/folders.

## Results

- Key metrics or observations.

## Future Work

- Possible improvements or extensions.

## License

- License information (if any).
```

For your digit classification notebook, you can reuse the content from the README drafted earlier, but save it in a file named exactly `README.md` in the project root.[^1]
